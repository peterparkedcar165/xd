## The goal of players in this mod is to grind and level up to unlock new abilities and refine them.
### Players start off as Novice, and must grind up to Level 5, until they can choose a class.
### Upon advancing, they immediate unlock the Innate Passive of the class as well as 1 Active Ability.
### Every 5 level increases the level of their abilities, up to a max of 4/4.
### At Level 30, they may advanced into their subclasses.
### Subclasses unlock immediate one active that replaces the old one, and one passive that is Innate to the class.
### The old passives and actives are both discarded for the new ones.
### At level 40, they unlock an active, at level 45, they unlock a passive, and so on. There is a total of 4 actives and 4 unlockable actives. Meaning that there is a gap of 40 levels between level ups. Up to a max of 4/4.
